# DigitalEstablishmentCapacityDirectory
Project: https://devpost.com/software/capazit

Description: 
  - In order to resolve it, we made a webpage that shows the number of people on different establishments (separated on different sections). To obtain the information, we create a google sheet that interact with a google form where every establishment register when a person enter and exit. The principal challenges that we had were to connect the google sheets with HTML and CSS. We are very proud of made an usable system with a kind plataform and we learned a lot about web development and conectivity between plataforms. The nex challenge for us is to implement our project in the real world with real establishments.
